There is a new minor version of Laravel almost every week. Also it includes a new feature very often which is not in Laravel documentation yet or is very poorly documented.

A lot of those features can be handy and that's the purpose of this website - to contains all undocumented or poorly documented features which we can use in our projects.

This project is open source and anybody can add a new feature, just create a new pull request. The purpose of this website is purely to help other developers. Any comments or feedbacks are welcome.
